## Project Overview

This project presents a framework that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) combined with surrogate aerodynamic modeling to optimize Formula 1 wing designs. The surrogate model, trained on synthetic CFD data generated by XFoil, accelerates the evaluation of aerodynamic metrics such as lift-to-drag ratio (L/D). The reinforcement learning agent, implemented using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), iteratively improves wing designs for optimal aerodynamic performance.
